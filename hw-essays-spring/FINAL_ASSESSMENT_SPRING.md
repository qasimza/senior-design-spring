# Final Assessment

## Part A- Individual Contribution, Skills Aplied/Built Upon, Success and Obstacles
 Being the only person on my team, I worked on this project start to end. This means that I was responsible for all phases of this project, starting from Prelimnary Research to Documentation and including Secondary Research, Protyping and Designing, Development, Testing and Verification, validation and Deployment, and Support for Additional Features.  
    
  The skills developed in the past both during class and through co-ops proved ot be immensely helpful in completing this project. Courses suck as **CS 5154:** Information Retrierval, and **CS 5152:** Intelligent Data Systems gave me a greater understaing of how information retrieval systems are implemented and how various measures of similarity are calcuated as well as the use cases for each method. Some of the discussions in this classes layed the foundation for addional research later in project as well (cosine similarity versus distance based measures - euclidean, mahalanobis, etc., bag-of-words-model, K-means and dealing with high-dimensional data). My co-op experiences were particularly useful in planning a complete, start-to-finish, software development plan as well as dealing with obstacles- switching the ionic app with a lightweight flask application to tackle time constraints.

What did you do and how did you do it? What did you learn and what competencies did you build? What were your successes, what were you obstacles?

## Part B- Group Accompishments, On Group Work, Teamwork, and Special Recognition
This project was able to produce the following results:
 - Successful implementation of a Flask application.  
 - Effectively find music based on a variety of parameters, including artist, year, and song title.  
 - At least 10 songs/query on average.  
 - At least 70 % median accuracy.  
 - 0.092 seconds/query.  
One of the most difficult parts of this project was working 
What did your group accomplish? 
What did you learn about group work? What aspects of teamwork were successful and what aspects of teamwork were not successful? 
How did your efforts on the project compare to that of your teammates?  
Do any team members deserve special recognition?
