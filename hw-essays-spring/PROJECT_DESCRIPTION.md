# Project Description

The most popular music listening and recommendation apps are Apple Music and Spotify. 
The former uses listening history and similarity to other users' tastes to recommend music, 
and the latter analyzes a song's rhythm and structure. Both do not ask users to specify their definition of "similarity"- 
by artists, years, and/or genres, etc. This project aims to provide better suggestions by doing so.
